/**
  *  ## Event re-targeting
  *  Some events bubble up through the DOM tree, so that they are detectable by
  *   any element on the page.
  *
  * Bubbling events fired from within shadow DOM are re-targeted so that, to any
  *  listener external to your component, they appear to come from your
  *  component itself.

  *  ## Custom Event Bubbling

  *  By default, a bubbling custom event fired inside shadow DOM will stop
  *  bubbling when it reaches the shadow root.

  *  To make a custom event pass through shadow DOM boundaries, you must set
  *  both the `composed` and `bubbles` flags to true.

  * The `move-out` event signals that the user pressed an **arrow** key or
  * **tab** key but there was no navigation possible inside the mathfield.
  *
  * This event provides an opportunity to handle this situation, for example
  * by focusing an element adjacent to the mathfield.
  *
  * If the event is canceled (i.e. `evt.preventDefault()` is called inside your
  * event handler), the default behavior is to play a "plonk" sound.

/**
 * The `MathfieldElement` class represent a DOM element that displays
 * math equations.
 *
 * It is a subclass of the standard
 * [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)
 * class and as such inherits all of its properties and methods.
 *
 * It inherits many useful properties and methods from `HTMLElement` such
 * as `style`, `tabIndex`, `addEventListener()`, `getAttribute()`,  etc...
 *
 * It is typically used to render a single equation.
 *
 * To render multiple equations, use multiple instances of `MathfieldElement`.
 *
 * The `MathfieldElement` class provides special properties and methods to
 * control the display and behavior of `<math-field>` elements.
 *
 *
 * You will usually instantiate a `MathfieldElement` using the
 * `<math-field>` tag in HTML. However, if necessary you can also create
 * it programmatically using `new MathfieldElement()`.
 *
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // 1. Create a new MathfieldElement
 * const mf = new MathfieldElement();
 *
 * // 2. Attach it to the DOM
 * document.body.appendChild(mf);
 * ```
 *
 * The `MathfieldElement` constructor has an optional argument of
 * `MathfieldOptions` to configure the element. The options can also
 * be modified later:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // Setting options during construction
 * const mf = new MathfieldElement({ smartFence: false });
 *
 * // Modifying options after construction
 * mf.smartFence = true;
 * ```
 *
 * #### MathfieldElement CSS Variables
 *
 * To customize the appearance of the mathfield, declare the following CSS
 * variables (custom properties) in a ruleset that applies to the mathfield.
 *
 * ```css
 * math-field {
 *  --hue: 10       // Set the highlight color and caret to a reddish hue
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively you can set these CSS variables programatically:
 *
 * ```js
 * document.body.style.setProperty("--hue", "10");
 * ```
 * <div className='symbols-table' style={{"--first-col-width":"25ex"}}>
 *
 * | CSS Variable | Usage |
 * |:---|:---|
 * | `--hue` | Hue of the highlight color and the caret |
 * | `--contains-highlight-background-color` | Backround property for items that contain the caret |
 * | `--primary-color` | Primary accent color, used for example in the virtual keyboard |
 * | `--text-font-family` | The font stack used in text mode |
 * | `--smart-fence-opacity` | Opacity of a smart fence (default is 50%) |
 * | `--smart-fence-color` | Color of a smart fence (default is current color) |
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * You can customize the appearance and zindex of the virtual keyboard panel
 * with some CSS variables associated with a selector that applies to the
 * virtual keyboard panel container.
 *
 * Read more about [customizing the virtual keyboard appearance](mathfield/guides/virtual-keyboards/#custom-appearance)
 *
 * #### MathfieldElement CSS Parts
 *
 * To style the virtual keyboard toggle, use the `virtual-keyboard-toggle` CSS
 * part. To use it, define a CSS rule with a `::part()` selector
 * for example:
 *
 * ```css
 * math-field::part(virtual-keyboard-toggle) {
 *  color: red;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * #### MathfieldElement Attributes
 *
 * An attribute is a key-value pair set as part of the tag:
 *
 * ```html
 * <math-field letter-shape-style="tex"></math-field>
 * ```
 *
 * The supported attributes are listed in the table below with their
 * corresponding property.
 *
 * The property can also be changed directly on the `MathfieldElement` object:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  getElementById('mf').value = "\\sin x";
 *  getElementById('mf').letterShapeStyle = "text";
 * ```
 *
 * The values of attributes and properties are reflected, which means you can
 * change one or the other, for example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * getElementById('mf').setAttribute('letter-shape-style',  'french');
 * console.log(getElementById('mf').letterShapeStyle);
 * // Result: "french"
 * getElementById('mf').letterShapeStyle ='tex;
 * console.log(getElementById('mf').getAttribute('letter-shape-style');
 * // Result: 'tex'
 * ```
 *
 * An exception is the `value` property, which is not reflected on the `value`
 * attribute: for consistency with other DOM elements, the `value` attribute
 * remains at its initial value.
 *
 *
 * <div className='symbols-table' style={{"--first-col-width":"32ex"}}>
 *
 * | Attribute | Property |
 * |:---|:---|
 * | `disabled` | `mf.disabled` |
 * | `default-mode` | `mf.defaultMode` |
 * | `letter-shape-style` | `mf.letterShapeStyle` |
 * | `min-font-scale` | `mf.minFontScale` |
 * | `max-matrix-cols` | `mf.maxMatrixCols` |
 * | `popover-policy` | `mf.popoverPolicy` |
 * | `math-mode-space` | `mf.mathModeSpace` |
 * | `read-only` | `mf.readOnly` |
 * | `remove-extraneous-parentheses` | `mf.removeExtraneousParentheses` |
 * | `smart-fence` | `mf.smartFence` |
 * | `smart-mode` | `mf.smartMode` |
 * | `smart-superscript` | `mf.smartSuperscript` |
 * | `inline-shortcut-timeout` | `mf.inlineShortcutTimeout` |
 * | `script-depth` | `mf.scriptDepth` |
 * | `value` | `value` |
 * | `math-virtual-keyboard-policy` | `mathVirtualKeyboardPolicy` |
 *
 * </div>
 *
 * See `MathfieldOptions` for more details about these options.
 *
 * In addition, the following [global attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes)
 * can also be used:
 * - `class`
 * - `data-*`
 * - `hidden`
 * - `id`
 * - `item*`
 * - `style`
 * - `tabindex`
 *
 *
 * #### MathfieldElement Events
 *
 * Listen to these events by using `addEventListener()`. For events with
 * additional arguments, the arguments are available in `event.detail`.
 *
 * <div className='symbols-table' style={{"--first-col-width":"27ex"}}>
 *
 * | Event Name  | Description |
 * |:---|:---|
 * | `beforeinput` | The value of the mathfield is about to be modified.  |
 * | `input` | The value of the mathfield has been modified. This happens on almost every keystroke in the mathfield. The `evt.data` property includes a copy of `evt.inputType`. See `InputEvent` |
 * | `change` | The user has committed the value of the mathfield. This happens when the user presses **Return** or leaves the mathfield. |
 * | `selection-change` | The selection (or caret position) in the mathfield has changed |
 * | `mode-change` | The mode (`math`, `text`) of the mathfield has changed |
 * | `undo-state-change` |  The state of the undo stack has changed. The `evt.detail.type` indicate if a snapshot was taken or an undo performed. |
 * | `read-aloud-status-change` | The status of a read aloud operation has changed |
 * | `before-virtual-keyboard-toggle` | The visibility of the virtual keyboard panel is about to change. The `evt.detail.visible` property indicate if the keyboard will be visible or not. Listen for this event on `window.mathVirtualKeyboard` |
 * | `virtual-keyboard-toggle` | The visibility of the virtual keyboard panel has changed. Listen for this event on `window.mathVirtualKeyboard` |
 * | `geometrychange` | The geometry of the virtual keyboard has changed. The `evt.detail.boundingRect` property is the new bounding rectangle of the virtual keyboard. Listen for this event on `window.mathVirtualKeyboard` |
 * | `blur` | The mathfield is losing focus |
 * | `focus` | The mathfield is gaining focus |
 * | `move-out` | The user has pressed an **arrow** key or the **tab** key, but there is nowhere to go. This is an opportunity to change the focus to another element if desired. <br\> `detail: \{direction: 'forward' | 'backward' | 'upward' | 'downward'\}` **cancellable**|
 * | `keypress` | The user pressed a physical keyboard key |
 * | `mount` | The element has been attached to the DOM |
 * | `unmount` | The element is about to be removed from the DOM |
 *
